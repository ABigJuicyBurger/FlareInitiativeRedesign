      The Flare Initiative was created in response to a gap in suicide tracking
      for first responders. Canada currently has no consistent system to track
      suicides among police, fire, EMS, corrections, or dispatch personnel.
      Existing information is fragmented, inconsistent, and inaccessible,
      leaving first responder agencies and mental health organizations unable to
      fully understand the scope of the issue or evaluate prevention efforts. By
      creating visibility on the true scale of first responder suicides, the
      Flare Initiative will provide the evidence base for effective prevention
      programs, inform policy changes, and reduce stigma around first responder
      mental health.
