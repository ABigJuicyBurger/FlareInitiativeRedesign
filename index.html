          The Flare Initiative was created in response to a gap in suicide
          tracking for first responders. Canada currently has no consistent
          system to track suicides among police, fire, EMS, corrections, or
          dispatch personnel. Existing information is fragmented, inconsistent,
          and inaccessible, leaving first responder agencies and mental health
          organizations unable to fully understand the scope of the issue or
          evaluate prevention efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          By creating visibility on the true scale of first responder suicides,
          the Flare Initiative will provide the evidence base for effective
          prevention programs, inform policy changes, and reduce stigma around
          first responder mental health.
